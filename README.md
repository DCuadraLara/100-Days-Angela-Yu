"🎮 Rock, Scissors, Paper"
A few weeks ago, I took a Udemy course. I don't remember exactly who the instructor was, but it was awesome! I learned a lot. I had already made a similar game before, so it felt like revisiting an old project.

As part of the 100 Days of Code course, I created a super fun version of "Rock, Scissors, Paper" where the AI always wins! (Just kidding — I'm just bad at it). It was a great opportunity to practice conditionals, work with ASCII art, and play around with random directory.
