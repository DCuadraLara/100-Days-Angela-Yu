"Rock, Scissors, Paper" – A few weeks ago, I took an Udemy course. I don't remember exactly who the instructor was, but it was awesome! I learned a lot. I had already made a similar game before, so it felt like revisiting an old project.
In the 100 Days of Code course, I created a super fun game where the AI always wins! Haha, just kidding — I'm just bad at it.
It's another great practice for conditionals, includes some ASCII art, and adds a bit of random directory too.
