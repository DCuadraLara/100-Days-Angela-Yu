# 📁 my-code-vault-dcl

**"My journey through code: daily exercises, challenges, and projects."**

A collection of mini-projects and exercises from my learning path in Python, mostly following the 100 Days of Code challenge on Udemy. Each script helped me learn and solidify core programming concepts — and have some fun along the way!

## 🎮 Rock, Scissors, Paper 

A few weeks ago, I took a Udemy course. I don't remember exactly who the instructor was, but it was awesome! I had already made a similar game before, so it felt like revisiting an old project.

As part of the 100 Days of Code course, I created a super fun version of "Rock, Scissors, Paper" where the AI always wins! (Just kidding — I'm just bad at it).  
It was a great opportunity to practice conditionals, use ASCII art, and play around with the `random` module.

## 🎮 Hangman 8-bit Edition 🧱🕹️ 

Today, after a few exercises with a robot in a maze and some other fun stuff, I ended up making a Hangman game!  
Our little guy is trying to survive us. We added some loops, conditionals, and just rolled with the code.

## 🛡️ Caesar Cipher 

This one was pretty fun — I built a basic Caesar cipher that shifts letters to encode or decode messages. It was a good exercise to practice loops, indexing, and modular arithmetic.  
Also made sure it **respects spaces** and symbols so you can write full sentences. Clean and simple.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Secret Auction 

A simple Python script that simulates a secret auction game.  
Users enter their name and bid amount, and the program keeps track of all entries using a dictionary.  
At the end, it determines who made the highest bid and declares the winner.

## 🧮 Chain Calculator

A simple Python script that simulates a basic calculator with operation chaining.
The user enters two numbers and selects an operation (+, -, *, /).
After the result is displayed, the user can choose to continue calculating with the result or start over.
The calculator handles multiple consecutive operations and ensures a smooth and interactive experience.

🃏 Blackjack Game
A simple Python script that simulates a terminal-based Blackjack game. The player starts with a fixed amount of money and can place bets in each round. Cards are drawn automatically for both the player and the croupier (dealer), with logic to manage hitting, staying, and calculating winners.
