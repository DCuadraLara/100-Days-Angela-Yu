# 📁 my-code-vault-dcl

**"My journey through code: daily exercises, challenges, and projects."**

A collection of mini-projects and exercises from my learning path in Python, mostly following the 100 Days of Code challenge on Udemy. Each script helped me learn and solidify core programming concepts — and have some fun along the way!

## 🎮 Rock, Scissors, Paper 

A few weeks ago, I took a Udemy course. I don't remember exactly who the instructor was, but it was awesome! I had already made a similar game before, so it felt like revisiting an old project.

As part of the 100 Days of Code course, I created a super fun version of "Rock, Scissors, Paper" where the AI always wins! (Just kidding — I'm just bad at it).  
It was a great opportunity to practice conditionals, use ASCII art, and play around with the `random` module.

## 🎮 Hangman 8-bit Edition 🧱🕹️ 

Today, after a few exercises with a robot in a maze and some other fun stuff, I ended up making a Hangman game!  
Our little guy is trying to survive us. We added some loops, conditionals, and just rolled with the code.

## 🛡️ Caesar Cipher 

This one was pretty fun — I built a basic Caesar cipher that shifts letters to encode or decode messages. It was a good exercise to practice loops, indexing, and modular arithmetic.  
Also made sure it **respects spaces** and symbols so you can write full sentences. Clean and simple.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Secret Auction 

A simple Python script that simulates a secret auction game.  
Users enter their name and bid amount, and the program keeps track of all entries using a dictionary.  
At the end, it determines who made the highest bid and declares the winner.
